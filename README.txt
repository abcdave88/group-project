The Three Things I Did:

The Three Thing I Did is a site that lets you track the places you’ve been around the world, along with the three favourite things you did while in that place.

You can share your map with friends and family, or view other people’s maps for inspiration on what three things your next trip should include.

In making this app, we implemented Express, Node, Ajax and Mongo.
